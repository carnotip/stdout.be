I'm always available for a chat with colleagues, or to discuss <a href="/en/work/">work</a>. I happily do guest posts if you ask nicely. You can reach me at <span class="me">stijn</span>.

You can reach me on Skype â€” my handle is <code>stdbrouw</code>. I'm in the CET timezone (UTC+1), or CEST (UTC+2) during daylight saving time. I don't idle that often, so it's best to schedule something over e-mail beforehand.

You can check out <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/stijndebrouwere">my page on Dopplr</a> to see if I'm ever in your part of the world, for a face-to-face chat.
