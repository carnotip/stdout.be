p(notice). I'm currently looking for a new gig, preferably full-time. However, I'm still taking on the odd freelance job, so you can contact me for either.

I work as software developer and information architect. To make sure I'm the best at what I do, I focus all my work on the publishing industry.

I've done guest posts at Lost Remote, the Online Journalism Blog and mediakritiek.be. One of my opinion pieces recently appeared in 'Handboek voor Crossmediale Journalistiek', a course book for journalism students at the University of Amsterdam.
