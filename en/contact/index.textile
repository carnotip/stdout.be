I'm always available for a chat with colleagues, or to discuss <a href="/en/services/">work</a>. I happily do guest posts if you ask nicely. You can reach me at <span class="me">stijn</span> or on <a href="http://twitter.com/stdbrouw">twitter</a>.

You can reach me on Skype â€” my handle is <code>stdbrouw</code>. I'm in the GMT timezone. I don't idle that often, so it's best to schedule something over e-mail beforehand.

You can check out <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/stijndebrouwere">my page on Dopplr</a> to see if I'm ever in your part of the world, for a face-to-face chat.
