<h1>Coding</h1>

<p>I've been coding in Django since 1.0, and did a lot of stuff in PHP/Drupal before that. I've done a lot of InDesign automation scripts in ExtendScript as well, and have recently become quite enamored by this whole <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> thing. I have some stuff up on <a href="http://github.com/stdbrouw/">GitHub</a>. I don't share my experiences and code as much as I should, but I try.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
