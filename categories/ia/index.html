<h1></h1>

<p>Information architecture is still a pretty new field and everyone pretty much defines it however they want to. While some people see it more <a href="http://stdout.be/2010/are-information-architects-ux-designers/">as a subdomain of user experience design</a>. I put more emphasis on how information is structured and how it flows through systems. <em>Architecture</em> is about more than just how things look and feel.</p>
