The concept of machine-understandable documents does not imply some magical artificial intelligence which allows machines to comprehend human mumblings. It only indicates a machine's ability to solve a well-defined problem by performing well-defined operations on existing well-defined data.

We remove the centralized concepts of absolute truth, total knowledge, and total provability, and see what we can do with limited knowledge.
