title: Journalism is access     
---

@Mary: “Arguing that journalism = access seems to me to put membership of an established journalistic organisation ahead of journalistic practice itself.” — I interpreted things the other way around: the fact that so many people have access to so many things that only they have access to (unique knowledge, unique experience, unique contacts, as Adam says) changes how we should think of journalism. It means everybody not just could, but should try to add to the news ecosystem, instead of leaving everything to journalists.

Interesting stuff, Adam, got me thinking.
