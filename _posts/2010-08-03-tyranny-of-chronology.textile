title: Follow-up journalism? Timeless journalism? It is the tyranny of chronology that gets in the way...

It's unfortunate that I'm only reading this now â€” your essay on the tyranny of chronology covers a lot of the same ground as "a series on IA for news websites I did earlier this year":http://stdout.be/2010/information-architecture-for-news-websites/. Then again, perhaps it's a good sanity check to see other people advocating for the same changes to how we handle news content, independently: the importance of extensive metadata and the importance not just of creating content but of managing it as well, and how current CMSes do a lousy job in that regard.

"It seems simply crazy to me that at a time when we are producing more media content than ever before, we are employing less and less people to expertly curate it - leaving it instead to machines and systems that we have not trained properly to deal with the complexity and nuances of our news 'language'." Yes!

The trouble is probably that metadata-driven systems prove their worth only over the long term, require an effort in annotating archival content and always involve custom development, which makes them a hard sell.
