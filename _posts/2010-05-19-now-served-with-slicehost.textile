title: Now served with Slicehost
---

Yep, I love Slicehost and their tutorials too, even though I’m now on Linode because of their London datacenter.

I would cut Apache out of the picture entirely though. Just use PHP-FPM, which is a FastCGI thingie that allows you to serve PHP straight from NGINX. Might be a bit harder to get going than simply running apt-get apache, but it’s more elegant and has less overhead.
