title: What is a (news) CMS
context: Are web CMSes antithetical to multi-channel publishing and structured data formats, or are we just using them wrong?

Hmm, defining what is and what isn’t a “root issue” is tricky business. Web CMSes expect that you’ll (first and foremost) publish to the web, and most of them use WYSIWYG editors that lead to semanti­cally worthless output… but then again, as you rightly point out, Curtiss, it’s certainly not impossible to swap out the editor in a CMS, or, heck, mark up content in straight XML, or output to PDFs or mobile apps or what ever. But it’d be so much nicer if a CMS would actually lend a helping hand and, y’know, help us manage all that stuff. And none of the CMSes out there really do.
