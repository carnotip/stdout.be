title: The future of investigative journalism
summary:
    
---

Investigative reporting is one of the core parts of what it means to be a journalist. It's why so many reporters think about themselves as providing a public good. But investigative journalism is growing to mean more than just narrative pieces: it's about news apps, public databases, libraries full of otherwise hard-to-find government documents and it's about Politifact-esque truthmeters.

I've just written "a post for Lost Remote":http://www.lostremote.com/2010/05/25/guest-post-the-future-of-investigative-journalism/ arguing — well, observing might be a better word — that investigative reporting is slowly but surely becoming an _ethos_ rather than an actual journalistic genre. Feel free to head over there and share your thoughts. Thanks!
