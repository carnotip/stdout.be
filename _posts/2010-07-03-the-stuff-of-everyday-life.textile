I also like Rosen’s no-nonsense nod to the ephemera that fills most blogs — personal stories about puppies and parades and little-league games or what have you. You take up blogging to talk about what’s meaningful to you, and of course it’s going to include the stuff of everyday life. Not every blogger needs to be covering the City Council or bringing down the government to matter. At the same time, when a private blogger does commit an act of journalism, let’s embrace and acknowledge it.
